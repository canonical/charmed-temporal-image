# Temporal Documentation Index

The following document serves as an index for documentation of the services in
this repo.

The documentation is loosely following the
[Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), although it only provides
Explanations and How-To Guides. The References are provided by the Temporal
maintainers and links to them are provided in these docs where relevant.
Tutorials on how to use the Temporal Server are provided in the Temporal SDK
wrappers that we also offer for Golang and Python. More details on that can be
found in the
[Temporal Server Architecture](./temporal-server/explanations/architecture.md).

Further, the individual components have documentation as outlined below.

### Temporal Server

explanation docs:

### TCTL

- [TCTL Plug-in Extensions](./tctl/explanations/plugins.md)
